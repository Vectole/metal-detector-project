## Metal Detector project for STM32 (blue pill board) re-written in Rust
This project is my playground for learning embedded Rust programming. 

The goal is to have:
  * working code comparable to my [original project](https://github.com/Vectole/metal-detector-project-arduino)
  * readability similar to the original project
  * code that takes advantage of Rust's features
  * additional features for the second version of my metal detector
